# Debouncing circuit 
Designed and implemented a debouncing circuit using both hardware and software approaches on a development kit, integrating components such as D flip-flops, asynchronous up-counters, and output registers for noise filtering, and employing microcontroller-based software algorithms to ensure clean and stable switch signal detection.
